<p>
  The organization were brought into existence by Sri Ramakrishna (1836-1886),
  the great 19th century saint from Bengal who is regarded as the Prophet of the
  Modern Age, and Sri Ramakrishna’s chief disciple, Swami Vivekananda
  (1863-1902), one of the foremost thinkers and religious leaders of the present
  age, who is regarded as ‘one of the main moulders of the modern world’, in the
  words of an eminent Western scholar A.L. Basham.
</p>
<p>
  Although Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission are legally and financially
  separate, they are closely inter-related in several ways and are regarded as
  twin organizations.
</p>
<p>
  These twin organizations have set in motion a non-sectarian, universal
  spiritual movement which has been silently working for more than a hundred
  years to catalyze the spiritual regeneration of humanity.
</p>

<p>
  Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission are global organizations known for
  their humanitarian and social service activities. For over a century, these
  non-political and non-sectarian spiritual organizations have been dedicated to
  serving people of all backgrounds, inspired by the ideals of renunciation and
  service. The monks and lay devotees work tirelessly to help millions, seeing
  the divine in everyone, regardless of caste, religion, or race.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Core Principles:</b>
</p>
<p>
  The Ramakrishna Mission is based upon the following two fundamental principles
  as taught by Swami Vivekananda based upon the life and realizations of his
  master Sri Ramakrishna:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>The potential divinity of all beings.</p></li>

  <li><p>The oneness of existence (the solidarity of the universe).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
  These two are the core principles of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna
  Mission organization.
</p>
<p>Implied from the above core principles are the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Principle of Freedom or liberation</p></li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Synthesis of the four yogas — jnanayoga, bhaktiyoga, karmayoga and
      rajayoga.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Harmony of religions</p></li>

  <li><p>Harmony of secular and sacred, or human and divine</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
  Freedom or liberation was the watchword of Swami Vivekananda — liberation from
  ignorance, narrowness, selfishness, poverty, superstition, squalor, etc. This
  liberation is both individual and collective, resulting in individual and
  universal upliftment. Swami Vivekananda realised the unity of the individual
  and the collective through a vision he had in Almora in the Himalayas — the
  oneness of the microcosm (individual,&nbsp;<i>vyashti</i>) and macrocosm
  (collective,&nbsp;<i>samashti).</i>
</p>
<p>
  The practical implementation of the motto he gave the Ramakrishna Mission,
  namely, आत्मनो मोक्षार्थं जगद्धिताय च (<i
    >Atmano Mokshartham Jagaddhitaya Cha)</i
  >, meaning “<i>for one’s own liberation and for the welfare of the world</i>”
  is embodied in an aphoristic principle given by his Master Sri Ramakrishna:
  शिव ज्ञाने जीव सेव (<i>Shiva jnane jiva seva)</i>, that is, “s<i
    >ervice of man is worship of God</i
  >” or “<i>service of God in man</i>”. This is the guiding&nbsp;

  About Ramakrishna Math &amp; Ramakrishna Mission Founder: Swami Vivekananda
  Founded: 1st May 1897 Headquarters' location: Belur Math, Howrah Location: 200
  Branch Centres Purposes: Education, Philanthropy, Religious studies,
  Spirituality The Math and the Mission are the two key organisations that
  direct the work of the socio-religious Ramakrishna movement influenced by
  19th-century saint Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and founded by his chief
  disciple Vivekananda. Also referred to as the Ramakrishna Order, the Math is
  the movement's monastic organization. Founded by Sri Ramakrishna in 1886, the
  Math primarily focuses on spiritual training and the propagation of the
  movement's teachings. The Mission, founded by Vivekananda in 1897 is a
  humanitarian organization which carries out medical, relief and educational
  programs. Both the organizations have headquarters at the Belur Math. The
  Mission acquired a legal status when it was registered in 1909 under Act XXI
  of 1860. Its management is vested in a Governing Body. Though the Mission with
  its branches is a distinct legal entity, it is closely related to the Math.
  The elected trustees of the Math also serve as Mission's Governing Body.
  Vedanta Societies comprise the American and Europian arm of the Movement and
  work more in purely spiritual field rather than social welfare.
